This page was inspired by [Kenny Johnston's README](https://gitlab.com/kencjohnston/README)

If we are communicating here are some things it might be helpful to know about me:

## About Me

My name is Nicole Schwartz

Pronouns: She/Her

### General
* I have one working eye
* My strengths are documenting and organizing.
* I have a weakness around providing enough granular detail, please let me know if I have not been clear or detailed enough!
* I tend to jump in where I see things needing some help whenever I can.
* I have been involved in the hacker scene since I was young, and before there was an Information Security industry. I am very excited to be involved in it as both a passion and a career.

### Product Management
* I enjoy being a Product Manager because it allows me to interact with customers, developers, designers, testers, and more. I love being able to help build a vision, get everyone on the same page, act as a subject matter expert on my area, and then have the ability to dive into designing or improving feature specifics. I work best as a senior individual contributor working across multiple development teams focused on information security at an emerging growth company offering IT based technology or productivity services.
* You can read more about good project management practices at [Silicon Valley Product Group - SVPG](https://svpg.com/)

### Communication
* I often make spelling mistakes. I am sorry but I really can not help it unless I go MUCH slower.
* I swear sometimes. Let me know if you mind and I will be extra dilligent to avoid it.
* The more excited I get the louder and faster I talk, and it tend to include arm waving.
* I believe in disagree, and commit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit 
* I love to argue about ideas or things, but let's avoid people.
* If you don't like to argue please let me know and I will take a different approach of exploring ideas when working with you.
* I often need to talk or roll ideas around with other people before they are fully formed. When I ask for comments or feedback on an issue feel free to rip the idea to shreds, constructively. I am a huge fan of rubber ducking!
* I tend to be hyperbolic when brainstorming, ask me if you aren't sure.

### Logistics

* When you need to reach me, here are my communication priorities and preference:
   * asynchronous
      * Slack - DM or @ me, if it is important, DM it
      * Email
         * I prefer to avoid email for items requiring discussion - better to create an issue, start a conversation on slack or setup a meeting
      * Google Document / Sheet / Slides / Confluence - Mention me using @ 
      * SMS - Emergencies only please.
   * synchronous
      * Video Conference (I have no preference between Zoom and Meet)
      * Phone - I am always in do-not-disturb mode and will not answer the phone unless I am expecting your call.
* FYI: I consider Slack, Email, and SMS to be asynchronous. If it needs to be synchronous please setup or request a meeting.
* If something is a TO DO / Task - I prefer GitHub issue or Jira or Email and a note in Slack as a heads up.
* If there is a timeline for a response needed, please specify it. For example - "Hey, can you review the issue before our meeting tomorrow?"
* Please do NOT just send "Hello" or "Hi" or "Have a minute"
* I might message you when you are not working (off hours), on vacation, or on a weekend or holiday. You can absolutely respond when you want, I am just trying to get it out of my head and over to you when an idea finishes forming.

### Feedback

* Please provide feedback to me, in private, and specifically indicate it is feedback. It will work best if you are clear and specific.
* Is there something I should include here to help you communicate with me? Submit a merge request.

### Outside of Work
* I am involved in the security community through being on the board and volunteer staff of multiple events - Diana Initiative (non profit, USA), BSides Edmonton (non profit, Canada), and Skytalks. I also dabble in other projects and research, sometimes with my husband.
* I am in OpenSSF working groups when I can.
* I speak at conferences about supply chain security in open source and DEI. 
* I used to own a tea company and still drink more tea than your average person.  
* I love to travel. 
* I love to play games (TTRPG, RPG, board, video, console, mobile). I currently am in a multi year D&D campaign, play Pokemon Go, and occasionally play ANCH and Pokemon (various) on my switch. 
* I have a rabbit, Jack, and two tuxedo cats, Knight and Jett.
